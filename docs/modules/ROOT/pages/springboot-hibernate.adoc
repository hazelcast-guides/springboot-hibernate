:description: In this tutorial, you'll learn how to quickly set up a Spring Boot application using Hazelcast as a Hibernate second-level cache.

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

{description}

== Before you Begin

In order to run the code sample, make sure to have PostgresSQL database accessible and configured properly in the `application.properties` file.

[TIP]
====
You can spin-up a PostgreSQL instance easily using Docker:
----
docker run --name 2lc-postgres --publish 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:13
----
====

== Configuration

In order to enable JPA, you need to add a dedicated Spring Boot Starter:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::ROOT:example$springboot-hibernate/pom.xml[tag=spring-boot-starter]
----

In order to configure Hazelcast as a second-level cache provider, you need to add two dependencies:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::ROOT:example$springboot-hibernate/pom.xml[tags=hazelcast-hibernate;hazelcast-dep]
----

And then, you need to configure the Hazelcast member setting by adding a standard `hazelcast.xml` file into `src/main/resources` directory.

Keep in mind that this might trigger the autoconfiguration of another Hazelcast member so you might want to disable Hazelcast autoconfiguration:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ROOT:example$springboot-hibernate/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/hibernate/springhibernate2lc/SpringHibernate2lcApplication.java[tag=doc-exclude]
----

The last step involves turning on second-level cache by adding two properties in the `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
include::ROOT:example$springboot-hibernate/src/main/resources/application.properties[tag=doc-second-level]
----

And now, after you annotate your entity as `@Cacheable`, it will be cached in Hazelcast member:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$springboot-hibernate/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/hibernate/springhibernate2lc/persistence/Book.java[tag=doc-cachable]
----

== Running the Application

Run the application by executing the following command.

----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

You should see in logs that Hazelcast members started successfully.

----
Members {size:1, ver:1} [
        Member [172.21.28.181]:5701 - f3984396-0ec9-40c8-861e-cb34f14d7204 this
]
----

What happens then is that an object is saved to the database and then fetched. In the meantime, the object is stored in the second level cache. `SecondLevelCacheVisualizer` prints out the L2C content in every 10 seconds. 

----
20:56:46.937644
size: 1
    com.hazelcast.hibernate.springhibernate2lc.persistence.Book#1:read-write Item(CacheEntry(com.hazelcast.hibernate.springhibernate2lc.persistence.Book))

20:56:56.997365
size: 1
    com.hazelcast.hibernate.springhibernate2lc.persistence.Book#1:read-write Item(CacheEntry(com.hazelcast.hibernate.springhibernate2lc.persistence.Book))
----

The object is then evicted from the L2C after 30 seconds, which is the configured time-to-live in `hazelcast.xml`.

----
20:57:17.028600
size: 0
----

== Summary

In this guide, you bootstrapped a Spring Boot application to use Hazelcast as a Hibernate second-level cache.
